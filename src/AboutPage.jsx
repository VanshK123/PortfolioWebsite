      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Vansh Khanna, a Computer Engineering student at Purdue University graduating in May 2024. Experienced in advanced programming and collaborative development, I played a key role in developing a secure Single Sign-On solution at Ernst & Young. As a Frontend Developer Intern at TestBook.com, I contributed to Agile development and optimized page performance. My diverse project portfolio, including a multi-threaded C++ server and a Full-stack Employee Information Management System, showcases my hands-on skills. Proficient in languages like C++, Java, and Python, along with certifications in Decoding DevOps and Google Tensor Flow, I'm eager to apply my knowledge and creativity to impactful tech projects.
